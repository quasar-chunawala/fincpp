I would like to research and implement algorithms and pricing analytics in modern C++. I would like to have a robust implementation of the core blocks one needs for such tasks - finite difference methods, tree methods, fourier transforms, characteristic functions, FFT etc. 

Over time, the cost of writing my own library and the understanding that comes with it will hopefully outweigh the sunk cost of building things ground up. Its a joy to write modern idiomatic and expressive C++ code.
